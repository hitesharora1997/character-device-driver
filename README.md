# Character Device Driver

## Overview
This project contains a series of implementations and examples for a character device driver in the Linux kernel. It includes various sessions demonstrating different aspects of kernel programming.

## Directory Structure
- `DEVICE_REGISTRATION`: Contains code for device registration.
- `helloKernel_program`: Basic hello world kernel module.
- `session_2+3` to `session_25_jiffies`: Various sessions covering different topics such as semaphores, spinlocks, wait queues, IOCTL, proc, jiffies, and more.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `READ_ME`: Additional documentation or notes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Linux-based system
- Kernel headers installed
- Basic knowledge of C and kernel programming

### Compilation and Installation
Navigate to the directory of the session you want to compile and install.

For example, to compile and install the code in `helloKernel_program`:
```sh
cd helloKernel_program
make
sudo insmod hello.ko
```

### Features
- Device registration and initialization
- Basic kernel module development
- Synchronization mechanisms (semaphores, spinlocks)
- Communication with user-space via IOCTL
- Usage of procfs and sysfs
- Timing operations with jiffies
